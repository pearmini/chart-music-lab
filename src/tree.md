# Tree: Harmony

What does a tree sound like? Click to play tree harmony, inspired by [Turtle Melody](https://editor.p5js.org/luisa/sketches/H11ZbqNa7). Trees generated by [Name2Tree](https://tree.bairui.dev/) from [ITP Spring Show 2025](https://itp.nyu.edu/shows/spring2025/projects/#11830-find-the-tree-in-your-name).

```js
import {tree} from "./tree.js";
import {html} from "npm:htl";
```

```js
const names = await FileAttachment("./data/names.json").json();
```

```js
const trees = names.map((item) => tree(item.name));

invalidation.then(() => trees.forEach((node) => node.dispose()));
```

<div class="grid grid-cols-3">
${trees.map(node => html`<div class="card">${node}</div>`)}
</div>
