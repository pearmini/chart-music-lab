Chart Music Lab is a collection of experiments exploring the intersection of charts and music. I'm particularly interested in the following two questions:

- What do charts sound like?
- How can we draw charts with music?

To explore this idea, I created the following pieces:

- **[Area: AV Instrument](./src/area.md)** - How to draw a [streamgraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streamgraph) with sounds?
- **[Bar: Composition Eye](./src/bar.md)** - How to use a single circle to mix different tracks?
- **[Dot: Dodge Drum](./src/dot.md)** -How to make sounds from a dodge chart?
- **[Grid: Github Melody Sequencer](./src/grid.md)** - What do my [GitHub](https://github.com/pearmini) contributions sound like?
- **[Contour: Timbre](./src/contour.md)** - How to draw contours with sound frequencies?
- **[Tree: Chord](./src/tree.md)** - What does a tree sound like?
