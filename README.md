# Chart Music Lab

> Bring music to charts, created by [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), [Observable Plot](https://observablehq.com/plot/) and [Observable Framework](https://observablehq.com/framework/).

Chart Music Lab is a collection of experiments exploring the intersection of charts and music. I'm particularly interested in the following two questions:

- What do charts sound like?
- How can we draw charts with music?

To explore this idea, I created the following pieces:

- **[Area: AV Instrument](https://music.bairui.dev/area)** - How to draw a [streamgraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streamgraph) with sounds?
- **[Bar: Composition Eye](https://music.bairui.dev/area/bar.md)** - How to use a single circle to mix different tracks?
- **[Dot: Dodge Drum](https://music.bairui.dev/area/dot.md)** -How to make sounds from a dodge chart?
- **[Grid: Github Melody Sequencer](https://music.bairui.dev/area/grid.md)** - What do my [GitHub](https://github.com/pearmini) contributions sound like?
- **[Contour: Timbre](https://music.bairui.dev/area/contour.md)** - How to draw contours with sound frequencies?
- **[Tree: Chord](https://music.bairui.dev/area/tree.md)** - What does a tree sound like?
