Chart Music Lab is a collection of experiments exploring the intersection of charts and music. It's not just about music visualization. I'm particularly interested in the following two questions:

- What do charts sound like?
- How can we draw charts with music?

To explore this idea, I created the following pieces:

- **[Area: AV Instrument](https://music.bairui.dev/area)** - How to draw a [streamgraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streamgraph) with sounds?
- **[Bar: Composition Eye](https://music.bairui.dev/area/bar.md)** - How to use a single circle to mix different tracks?
- **[Dot: Dodge Drum](https://music.bairui.dev/area/dot.md)** - How to make sounds from a dodge chart?
- **[Grid: Github Melody Sequencer](https://music.bairui.dev/area/grid.md)** - What do my [GitHub](https://github.com/pearmini) contributions sound like?
- **[Contour: Timbre](https://music.bairui.dev/area/contour.md)** - How to draw contours with sound frequencies?
- **[Tree: Harmony](https://music.bairui.dev/area/tree.md)** - What does a tree sound like?

These experiments also serve as good ways to learn elements of music: [rhythm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm), [melody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melody), [timbre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbre), and [harmony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony). I may explore more charts in the future, such as [arrow chart](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-arrow-variation-chart). For now, let's bring music to charts!
